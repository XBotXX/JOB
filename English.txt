Reality television is a genre of television programming which, it is claimed, presents unscripted dramatic or humorous situations, documents actual events, and features ordinary people
rather than professional actors. 
Although the genre has existed in some form or another since the early years of
television, the current explosion of popularity dates from around 2000.
3)Critics say that the term "reality television" is somewhat of a misnomer and that such shows
frequently portray a modified and highly influenced form of reality.
Part of reality television's appeal is due to its ability to place ordinary people in extraordinary
situations. For example, on the ABC show, The Bachelor, an eligible male dates a dozen women simultaneously, travelling on extraordinary dates to scenic locales.
Some commentators have said that the name "reality television" is an inaccurate description
for several styles of program included in the genre.
Producers specifically select the participants, and use carefully designed scenarios, challenges,
events, and settings to encourage particular behaviours and conflicts.
